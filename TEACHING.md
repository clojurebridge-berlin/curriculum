ClojureBridge Teacher's Guide
=============================

There are many ways to teach the ClojureBridge material, and none of them are "right." The following is a guide to working though the curriculum with students based on the experience of some workshop organizers and teachers.

There are two pieces to the curriculum: the curriculum
[slides and narrative](http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/curriculum),
and the capstone app,
[Drawing Lines](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/first-program.md).

The slides and the narrative curriculum are the exactly the same
files. The slide forms are what you show on the projector in front of
the room, while the narrative forms are easy to read detailed
explanation of what is introduced in the slides. Students follow along
with the narrative on their own computers or use it to work on their
own.


Curriculum
----------
Use your ClojureBridge chapters's GitHub account to fork the curriculum [repository](https://github.com/ClojureBridge-berlin/curriculum). You can use your chapter's fork to make changes or tweaks to the curriculum for your workshop. If you make changes that would be valuable for everyone, please consider making a pull request against the ClojureBridge Berlin curriculum.


Schedule
--------
Friday evening: Installfest - [Getting Set Up](outline/setup.md) in the outline.

Saturday: Workshop -  [curriculum](README.md#curriculum).


Preparation
-----------
Print the ([markdown](outline/cheatsheet.md) or [pdf](ClojurebridgeCheatsheet-v2.pdf)) and hand it out to students at the beginning of the day on Saturday.


Room Setup
----------
It works best to have attendees sit around tables, facing one another. This encourages attendees to help one another and makes it easier for coaches to walk around the room, answering questions.


Presentation of the Material
----------------------------
Most workshops have both teachers and coaches. Teachers present the material at the front of the room, and coaches and teachers help students as they work through the exercises on their own and with their tablemates.

This is not the only way to present the material. It is just the way we have seen it done at most of the workshops so far. Please feel free to experiment.


Beginner and Advanced Tracks
----------------------------
We survey the attendees ahead of time and during the Installfest to find out their levels of programming experience. If you have multiple teachers available, you could present the material in separate rooms at a different pace, or you could present separate material. Alternatively, you could keep all attendees in the same room but seat them in different tables according to ability.


Exercises
---------
Provide plenty of time for exercises. That is where the real fun happens. Coaches should sit with attendees or circulate around the tables as the attendees work on exercises.
